### Project Overview

This is a comparison study of binary classification machine learning models. The German Credit Data dataset will be used to train and test various binary classification models.  Upon completing of this study the goal  is to replicate the findings of academic peers that XGBoost offer the best binary classification performance measured by ROC AUC. 

### IDE

#### Google Colab

Google Colab (short for Colaboratory) lets users write and execute Python code in a web browser, with free access to GPUs and easy sharing of notebooks. Itâ€™s widely used for prototyping, collaborating, and learning, especially in fields like data analytics and AI.

#### Environment Notes

_File Importing_

Required files are saved locally and uploaded using upload.() to Google Colab - should you wish to run this Python Notebook locally you will need to edit the import to support your personal development enviroment. 

_Required Libraries_ 

This study relies heavily on **_sci-kit-learn_** but also uses several other established Python libraries. 

See blank-blank.python for comprehsive list of libraries
